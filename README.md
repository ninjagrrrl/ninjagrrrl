With a background in the humanities, I bring structure, creativity, and strong communication skills to front-end development. I enjoy learning new technologies and working in collaborative, cross-functional teams. Currently, I'm building a website for a friend's medical practice using Craft CMS and Next.js. With this project, I want to explore content modeling, templating, and the potential of combining traditional and headless CMS approaches. It's also an opportunity for me to deepen my understanding of production-ready React and the backend capabilities that Next.js enables.

#### Currently Learning

- **Craft CMS** – experimenting with its content modeling and templating system while building a website for a friend's medical practice.
- **Next.js** – to deepen my understanding of how React is used in real-world applications, especially in terms of routing, performance, and content structure.
