#### Hey :)

With a background in the humanities, I bring structure, creativity, and strong communication skills to web development. I thrive in collaborative settings and am excited about building websites for individuals with unique passions. Creating digital spaces that truly reflect the people behind them — empowering their daily lives and celebrating the diversity of their perspectives — is a challenge I’m excited to take on. I also genuinely enjoy learning new technologies and continuously expanding my skillset.

#### Currently Working On

I’m working on two projects to deepen my skills in different CMS approaches:

- **A visually-driven website for a musician friend**  
  Built with *Craft CMS* and *Next.js*, exploring content modeling, templating, and combining traditional and headless CMS techniques.

- **Website for a dental practice**  
  Using *WordPress*, focusing on PHP templating, manual theme development, and hosting concepts.

Both projects allow me to grow my frontend and backend skills and connect theory with practical implementation.

#### Currently Learning

- *Next.js* to deepen my understanding of server-side rendering, routing, and full-stack React applications.  
- *Twig templating language* to create flexible and maintainable templates in Craft CMS.  
- *PHP fundamentals* to deepen my understanding of WordPress theme development and backend logic.  
- *Deployment workflows* and hosting concepts to smoothly move projects from local environments to live servers.
